            During my work experience, I have worked primarily in retail. My first job was in 2018 at Rue21 as a sales associate, and I had my first assistant manager position at that job. In 2020 I worked as a sales associate in the clothing and style department at Target. Within 2021 I worked at JCPenney working as a cashier and sales associate. Currently, I am working in a work-study position at Colorado State University-Pueblo while I continue pursuing my Bachelor's Degree. I work at the Library on campus in the Catalog Department, and I assist in mending and fixing books.
