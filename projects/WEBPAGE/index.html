        <p>
            My name is Hailee Langowski. I was born in Pueblo, Colorado, on September 22nd, 2000, and I have lived here my whole life. I live with my grandparents and my seven-year-old cat, Spinderella. She is named after the DJ of the 90's rappers Salt 'N Pepa. I am in my third year at Colorado State University-Pueblo. I am majoring in Media Communication: Multimedia Journalism Concentration, with minors in Women Studies and Sociology. I am very interested in music and art. I love enjoying the outdoors and traveling. My favorite place I have traveled to is Rome, Italy, because of the rich history sculpted into the city. I am unsure about a career path in my future, but I know I would like to travel throughout my lifetime. As well as reach out to communities to better understand other people's struggles and help those around me.
